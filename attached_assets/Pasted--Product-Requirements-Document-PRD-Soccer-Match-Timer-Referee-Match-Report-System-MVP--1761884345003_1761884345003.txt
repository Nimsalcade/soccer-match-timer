### 4.2 Screen 2: Live Match Timer Interface

#### 4.2.1 Timer System

**Match Structure**

- **First Half**: 0:00 to 45:00 minutes
- **Second Half**: 45:00 to 90:00 minutes
- **Display Format**: MM:SS (minutes:seconds)

**Timer States**

1. **Idle**: Timer at 0:00, ready to start first half
1. **Countdown**: 3-2-1 countdown before each half begins
1. **Running**: Timer actively counting up
1. **Paused**: Timer stopped, accumulating stoppage time
1. **Stoppage Time**: Red timer showing accumulated extra time
1. **Half-Time Transition**: Display “STARTS SECOND HALF” message
1. **Match Complete**: Timer reaches 90:00 + stoppage time

**Stoppage Time Logic**

- All pause durations are automatically tracked and logged
- Stoppage time accumulates separately for each half
- System records timestamp of each pause/resume
- At 45:00 (or 90:00), if stoppage time exists:
  - Main timer shows 45:00 (or 90:00)
  - Stoppage timer appears in red
  - Stoppage timer counts up from 0:00 to total accumulated time
- When stoppage time completes:
  - First half: Display “STARTS SECOND HALF” message
  - Second half: Match concludes, navigate to Match Report

#### 4.2.2 Timer Event Logging

All timer events are logged with timestamps for the match report:

|Event Type        |Data Captured                                         |

|First Half End    |Timestamp, regulation time end, stoppage time duration|
|Half-Time Duration|Time between halves                                   |
